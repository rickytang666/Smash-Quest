## Smash Quest

### Problem Statement

Many of us are passionate about sports but lack the resources and expertise to make significant progress. As amateur athletes, we often find it challenging to analyze our training sessions and identify areas for improvement. Traditional sports analysis tools are either too expensive or require a level of expertise that we simply don't have. This lack of accessible feedback can hinder our growth and enjoyment of the sport.

### Solution Overview

Smash Quest is designed to bridge this gap for everyday athletes. Using AI and Dartfish, our platform analyzes your training sessions and provides actionable insights and tips. You don’t need to be a pro to get pro-level analysis. Our no-code platform allows you to upload videos, which are then processed by our AI to pinpoint strengths and weaknesses. Personalized tips and drills are generated, giving you clear guidance on how to improve. Plus, our incentive-based system encourages you to stay motivated by rewarding your progress.

### Mockup/Prototype Walkthrough

When you log in, you’re greeted by a user-friendly dashboard that showcases your training history and progress. The main feature is the video upload tool. Once you upload your training video, the AI gets to work, analyzing your performance. You’ll receive a detailed breakdown of metrics like speed, accuracy, and technique, along with customized tips and drills. Our incentive system is prominently displayed, showing your earned points and rewards, which keeps you motivated to continue training.

### Market Potential and Future Plans

Smash Quest has significant market potential because it caters to the vast majority of athletes who are not professionals but still want to improve. While we’re starting with table tennis, our AI capabilities can be scaled to support multiple sports. Future developments will include more advanced analytics, a broader sports library, and a community feature where users can share their progress and tips. This ensures that Smash Quest can grow with its users and remain relevant to a broad audience.
